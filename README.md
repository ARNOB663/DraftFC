  auctionTimeLimit: 30,        // Seconds per auction

};

## 📝 Scoring Algorithm

```javascript
// Position Balance
const idealPositions = { GK: 1, DEF: 4, MID: 3, ATT: 3 };

// Synergy Bonuses
- 3+ players from same nation: +5 per extra player
- 2+ players from same club: +10 per extra player

// Final Score
finalScore = (avgRating × 0.5) + (positionBalance × 0.3) + (synergy × 0.2)
```
